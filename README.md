# -Statistical-analysis-
This project focuses on the statistical analysis and visualization of water quality data in the Huay Kaew Watershed, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. Using advanced statistical techniques, the analysis assesses key physico-chemical parameters such as temperature, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient concentrations across different sites and months. Key features of the project include correlation analysis, ANOVA testing to identify significant differences in water quality across locations, and Welch's t-test to compare specific sites. The project also incorporates visualization techniques like bar plots, correlation heatmaps, and grouped mean calculations to summarize trends. This analysis provides actionable insights for sustainable water resource management in the region and demonstrates the application of Python for environmental data science.
