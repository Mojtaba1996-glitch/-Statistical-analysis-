# -Statistical Analysis of Water Quality in the Huay Kaew Watershed
This project conducts a comprehensive statistical analysis and visualization of water quality data from the Huay Kaew Watershed, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. Advanced statistical methods are applied to evaluate key physico-chemical parameters, including temperature, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient concentrations, across multiple locations and time periods. Key analyses include:

*Correlation Analysis: To explore relationships between parameters.
*ANOVA and Welchâ€™s t-test: To identify significant variations across sites and months.
*Data Visualization: Utilizing bar plots, correlation heatmaps, and grouped mean calculations to illustrate trends effectively.
This project demonstrates the integration of Python-based statistical techniques with environmental data science to provide actionable insights for sustainable water resource management in the region.
